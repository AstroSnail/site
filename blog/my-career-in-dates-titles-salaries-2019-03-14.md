# My Career So Far in Dates/Titles/Salaries

The following tables are a view on my software career in dates/titles/salaries I was employed (company names omitted). Let this be inspiration to whoever is afraid of trying, failing and being fired. Every single one of these jobs has taught me lessons I've used daily in my career.

I don't have exact dates on these, but my first jobs were:

- Grocery Bagger - early-mid high school
- Pizza Delivery Driver - late high school early college
- Paper Grader - Fall quarter of 2012

I ended up walking out on the delivery job, that's a story for another day.

I've been fired three times and I'm still fine and valued enough for a company to want to hire me over the border. Go for your dreams of larger success. And yet without any of the failures in this chain of jobs, I would never have succeeded the way I did. Personally, I'd probably rather regret action more than inaction.

I don't regret my career as it's been so far. It's been the ride of a lifetime. I can't wait to see what's next out of it. I only wonder how I can be transformed even more.
