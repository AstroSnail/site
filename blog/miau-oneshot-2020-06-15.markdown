# 6E Oneshot: Retrieve the Sandstorm Amulet

## Intro

I've been working on ideas for an original fiction novel about someone that
rediscovers magic in an incredibly secular world. This is a bit of a bigger task
(and would really be one of the biggest works of art I've ever done), and coming
up with ideas for it can be difficult. I've also been casually interested in
[Dungeons and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) for a
long time, but have never had the chance to play it. Though it is a great tool
to help guide the creation of stories, it can be intimidating and complicated to
get into. There really is a lot going on there. Recently [itch.io][itch] created
a [Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality][itchbundle], and one of the items in
there was [6E][sixe], a simplified view of Dungeons and Dragons that is aimed to
be very rules-light and focus on the situations.

This is great if you have ideas for what to do in a campaign, but sometimes you
just don't. This is an idea that you can build on for a small, short one-shot
adventure with [6E][sixe]. This should only take an hour or two and is perfect
for helping people get into the flow of table-top role-playing games. You will
need the following things:

- 4-5 people (including yourself) willing to play together (whether in person or
  over the internet)
- Six-sided dice (at least 4) or a chatbot that can handle dice rolling for you
- The playbook PDF from the [6E page on itch.io][sixe]
- A bit of creativity (you can work together if you are suddenly lacking
  inspiration)
- A willingness to learn

## Setting

Deep in the desert wasteland of Miau there is a cove for bandits. This cove is
full of bandits and evil boomerang rats. You and your party walk into the
entrance of the cave. There is a torch by the entrance. What do you do?

## Process

Choose someone to be the Dungeon Master. Give them the sheets for the Dungeon
Master and then have the others start filling out their stats. Rolling for stats
is done like on the Dungeon Master character creation sheet:

For each stat (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and
charisma), roll two six-sided dice. Add them up and convert them into stats
using these rules:

| Roll         | Stat   |
| :----------- | :----- |
| 11 and above |     +2 |
| 9-10         |     +1 |
| 6-8          |     +0 |
| 4-5          |     -1 |
| 3 and below  |     -2 |
